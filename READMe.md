# Description
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

This is an online web application used to schedule and save events in a daily planner.

# Installation
N/A

# Usage
On page load you will find time slots where you can input an event.
Once you hit the save button to the right, the event will save until you clear your 'cash' (computer console memory).

As the day goes on, the different hours will change color based on what time it is. 

Green - Present Time
Red - Time passed
Grey - Future Time
